                <h2>What is +=?</h2>
                <p>+= (Plus-Equals) is an experiment in hacking the way hackathons are run with the primary goal of increasing the inclusivity and diversity of these wonderful events which connect people and ideas to bring them to life in a remarkably short amount of time. We want to answer the question of how much fuller life could be if more people harnessed hackathons to learn about their own creative potential. Given what people show you can create in a weekend long hackathon, what would we collectively create over the course of our lives if we could achieve that level of creative output on a regular basis?</p>
                <p>+= is the addition assignment operator, i.e. x += y is the same as saying x = x + y. To translate for the nonprogrammer, the += operator changes the value of one thing to include the addition of another. So at first Plus-Equals was just this idea, you see. Then Plus-Equals += me. And should you choose, <a  href="http://eepurl.com/bzQaCD">Plus-Equals += you.</a>  And then together we can hack the future of the hackathon, which was itself always a hacking of the power of collective intention and collaboration.</p>

                <h2>Why hack hackathons?</h2>
                <p>Why does it take more fuel to drive a car in stop-and-go traffic? Inertia. Unless a force acts upon it, an object at rest will remain at rest and in motion it will remain in motion. And so it is with ideas. It takes a lot of energy to get an idea off the ground, to develop it until it truly has momentum. In a stop-and-go environment, the input of energy may never reach a point where an idea can truly flourish.</p>
                <p>When even a few individuals commit to spend a weekend together hacking their ideas to life, it creates a space in time where ideas receive the most nurturing sort of environment. That is the essence of a hackathon, to provide a setting where the resonance of collective intention gives ideas the continuous attention they need to thrive, further nourished by the opportunity for their creators to learn from and collaborate with other individuals with a diverse set of skills and passions.</p>
                <p>While hackathons may be focused on helping ideas grow, they also inevitably help people grow. It is our opinion that a hackathon can be one of the more empowering experiences one can have. Whether first time participant or veteran hacker, it's always astonishing to see what that hackathon setting can help you to learn about your capability to overcome challenges and create something awesome in a short amount of time.</p>

                <h2>Who should join hackathons?</h2>
                <p>We believe that diversity is one of the key factors in making a hackathon awesome, and thus we're all about inclusivity. The short answer then is anyone and particularly, <strong>you</strong>, if you've read this far in the page and are still intrigued. Not every hackathon is appropriate for everyone; the theme of a hackathon might or might not align with your interests, and if you're a first timer, some more competitive hackathons might not be the friendliest place to start.</p>
                <p>If you're interested in joining a hackathon but having trouble finding one that's both the right fit and geographically accessible, we encourage you to reach out and <a href="#contact">tell us what you're looking for.</a> We'd like to help. We hope to find ways to make it more possible for more hackathons to include options for people to get involved, whether it's to include those with different skillsets than what is normally associated with a hacker, or ways to get involved remotely.</p>

                <h4>Music Tech Fest +=</h4>
                <p>The catalyst for the birth of +=: Sean and CJ both loved the <a href="http://musictechfest.net/mtfboston/" target="_blank">MTF Boston</a> hackathon enough that Sean took a flight to participate in <a href="http://musictechfest.net/mtflondon/" target="_blank">MTF London</a> and CJ submitted a hack remotely while on a road trip across the US. They were then inspired to start organizing "telehackathons" to allow themselves and other Boston area hackers to continue to participate in MTF hackathons.</p>
                <p>So far there have been 3 editions of MTF Hack Camp += Boston, coinciding with MTF events in <a href="http://musictechfest.net/mtfparis/" target="_blank">Paris</a>, <a href="http://musictechfest.net/mtfberlin/" target="_blank">Berlin</a>, and <a href="http://musictechfest.net/mtfscandi/" target="_blank">Scandi</a>. One of the goals of these telehackathons was to generate remote collaborations between Boston and European hackers. So far, we still have not figured out how to accomplish that, but we did succeed in organizing zero-budget hackathons and having Boston hackers be recognized at and win prizes from the main events.</p>
                <p>To coincide with <a href="http://musictechfest.net/" target="_blank">MTF Central</a>, CJ is organizing a <a href="http://remix.army/20songs/">20 Song Game Trackathon</a> while Sean is busy running Hacking Eating Tracking.<br/> <a href="http://musictechfest.net/" target="_blank">Music Tech Fest</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/telehackmtf" target="_blank">@TeleHackMTF</a>  </p>

                <h4>Hacking Eating Tracking</h4>
                <p>After his experience organizing MTF += Boston events, Sean was very excited when his PI suggested that they work together to organize a Symposium/Hackathon hybrid event about quantified eating behavior. The idea of bringing together scientists, hackers, and even artists to generate a cross-disciplinary dialogue and catalyze the development of new tools and methods to study eating behavior resonated strongly with the += vision of diverse and inclusive hackathons that break the mould.</p>
                <p>Sean took advantage of the opportunity to organize a hackathon more full-time and with an actual budget to experiment with ways of implementing aspects of the += vision at scale. At first toying with the idea of having satellite events, he eventually settled on travel reimbursements as the best way of increasing the inclusivity of the event, bringing in around 40 out-of-town participants.</p>
                <p>He also conducted video chats with over 70 participants before the event. This increased the sense of inclusivity by helping applicants who weren't sure if they'd be a good fit to understand how their skillsets could be helpful, and connecting them with potential teammates ahead of time.<br/><a href="http://hackingeatingtracking.org" target="_blank">Hacking Eating Tracking</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/HackEatTrack" target="_blank">@HackEatTrack</a></p>
